# Advent of Code 2023 in Zig
![](aybabtu.jpg)

*"Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015.*

*The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language." -* [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)

For my programming language of choice, I will be using the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) Programming Language.

### ⚠ WARNING ⚠
By the time of writing this, Zig is STILL currently a ***VERY VERY*** new language (v0.12.0-dev). Everything you see here might not translate well in future versions of Zig. So please keep this in mind before compiling.

## How to run
1. `clone` the repo
2. With Zig v0.12.0 `build` the program.
```
zig build
```
3. Change directory into `zig-out/bin/`
4. Run it.
